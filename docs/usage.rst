Usage
=====

The basic workflow for building a model service is as follows

1. Instantiate an instance of :class:`porter.services.ModelApp`. This is simply an abstraction for the REST app that will expose your models.
2. Define model classes for each service you want to add to the app. A single service consists of a model that satisfies the :class:`porter.datascience.BaseModel` interface. Additionally you can define processor classes (objects implementing the :class:`porter.datascience.BasePreProcessor` or :class:`porter.datascience.BasePreProcessor` interface) for pre/post processing of model input/output respectively. If you have a serialized sklearn and/or keras object and/or your model is on S3, classes in :class:`porter.datascience` can help load these objects.
3. Instantiate classes, such as :class:`porter.services.PredictionService`, with the appropriate arguments for each model you would expose through the app.
4. Pass the config service from (3) to the ``add_serivce()`` method of your :class:`porter.services.ModelApp` instance.
5. Call the ``run()`` method of your :class:`porter.services.ModelApp` instance. Your model is now live!

See this `examples/example.py <https://github.com/CadentTech/porter/blob/master/examples/example.py>`_ for an (almost functional) example.


Running porter apps in production
---------------------------------

There are two ways to run porter apps. The first is calling the :meth:`porter.services.ModelApp.run` method. This is just a wrapper to the underlying  `flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_  app which is good for development but not for production. A better way to run porter apps in production is through a production-grade WSGI server, such as  `gunicorn <https://gunicorn.org/>`_. To do so simply define an instance of :class:`porter.services.ModelApp` in your python script and then point gunicorn to it.

For example, in your python script ``app.py``

.. code-block:: python

    model_app = ModelApp(...)

Then for production use, either in a shell script or on the command line

.. code-block:: shell

    gunicorn app:model_app
